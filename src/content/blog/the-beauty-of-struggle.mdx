        *Find what you love and let it kill you.*

        *Let it drain you of your all.*

        *Let it cling onto your back and weigh you down into eventual nothingness.*

        *Let it kill you and let it devour your remains.*

</p>
<br/>
<p>
    *Let the passion you hold become the fire that consumes you,*

    *Burning brightly until there is nothing left but ash.*

    *Let 'em seep into your bones,*

    *A relentless force that drives you forward,*

    *Even as it tears you apart.*

</p>
<br/>
<p>
    *Embrace the exhaustion that comes with the pursuit,*

    *For in the tiredness, there is purpose.*

    *In the weariness, there is meaning.*

    *And though it may leave you hollow,*

    *It is a hollowing out that fills you with life,*

    *A paradox that only those who love deeply can understand.*

</p>

<br/>
<p>
    *So yes, maybe I am romanticizing work a bit,*

    *But isnâ€™t that the point?*

    *To find beauty in the struggle,*

    *To see love in the grind,*

    *To be consumed by what we cherish most,*

    *And to know, in the end, that it was worth it.*

</p>
<br/>
<p>
    *For all things will kill you, both slowly and fastly,*

    *But isn't it much better to be killed by a lover?*

</p>
